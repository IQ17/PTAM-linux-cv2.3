PTAM: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gk/PTAM/

This source code is based on the installation from kameda-lab (http://www.kameda-lab.org/_local/imagelab.tsukuba.ac.jp/ubuntu1004+opencv21/PTAMk/) with some modifications for OpenCV2.3.1

All you need to do is move to PTAM-linux-go directory and run the script.
(Or you can go all the steps manually by youself; see the script.)

$ cd 
$ cd PTAM-linux-go 
$ bash ./PTAM-linux-go.bash 

Modifications are placed in PTAM-linux-cv2.3/hack/PTAM/PTAM-r114-linux.patch
